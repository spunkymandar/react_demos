Create a react application FullNameGenerator, which contains NameComponent component in the main component i.e. App component.
In NameComponent, add two textfields to enter the firstname and the last name. 
The NameComponent should generate the fullname automatically upon the values changed in the firstname and the last name. 

(make the use of useState(), also update the code using the callback function for state updates)
